Any transactions or activity between you and any third party site or resource is solely between you and the applicable third party, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such activity shall be between you and them. You recognize that certain third party providers of ancillary services may require your agreement to additional or different license or other terms prior to your use or access of their sites or services.

5. Customer Advertising Accounts. 
5.1 Customer Advertising Account Access. Edge.BI's Service is designed to allow you to manage certain advertising campaigns through your Edge.BI User Account and accounts you establish with third party advertising companies. You agree to allow Edge.BI to automatically retrieve data from any and all advertising accounts for which you enter the necessary login data into the Service ("Customer Advertising Accounts"). You represent and warrant that you have the permission, authority and rights to allow Edge.BI to automatically access such Customer Advertising Accounts. You agree that Edge.BI is not responsible for any liability associated with accessing and retrieving data from Customer Advertising Accounts on your behalf or on behalf of any entity for which you create a Customer Advertising Account. You agree to immediately disable access in your User Account to any Customer Advertising Account for which you do not have full legal right of access. You represent and warrant that you have reviewed and agree that you are solely responsible for complying with any and all terms, conditions and policies that apply to your interactions with any third party advertising provider through any Customer Advertising Account or Edge.BI's Service. You shall indemnify and hold Edge.BI, its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, affiliates, licensors and subcontractors harmless from any claim, costs, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments and expenses (including reasonable fees of attorneys and other professionals whether or not suit is brought), arising out of or in connection with any claim, action or proceeding (any and all of which are "Claims") arising out of or related to any act or omission by you in using the Service, the Customer Advertising Accounts, or related to the development, operation, maintenance, use and contents of any Customer Advertising Account campaign, including but not limited to any infringement of any third party proprietary rights. At Edge.BI's option, you shall assume control of the defense and settlement of any Claim subject to indemnification by you (provided in such event, Edge.BI may at any time thereafter elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of any such Claim, and in any event, you shall not settle any such Claim without Edge.BI's prior written consent). 

5.2 Customer Beware. You acknowledge that Edge.BI does not own, control or operate the Customer Advertising Accounts, and that the provision of third party advertising is pursuant to an agreement between you and such advertising provider. You understand and agree that data made available through the Edge.BI Service is dependent upon such third party providers, and is subject to errors in creation, Transmission, data loss, time delay and other factors beyond Edge.BI's control. You understand and agree that the third party advertising provider and your Customer Advertising Account as accessed directly through such provider, and not through Edge.BI, is the only information upon which you are entitled to rely with respect to modifications or data related to an advertising campaign. Edge.BI provides any such data accessed from a third party system for your convenience only, and does not make any representation or warranty as to its accuracy or timeliness. Any recommendations, projections, forecasts, extrapolations, suggestions, or other summaries provided by Edge.BI, whether forward or backward looking or based upon current circumstances are nothing more than the opinion of Edge.BI based upon the best information Edge.BI was able to access from such third party provider and based upon the time at which such data was Transmitted to Edge.BI (which may not be current at the time you view it). You agree not to rely on such opinions in making any advertising management decisions without first verifying the accuracy to your satisfaction directly through your Customer Advertising Account. The Service also comprises compilations of data from various third party advertising providers. Neither the individual Customer Advertising Account data, nor the compilation nor comparison data is guaranteed by Edge.BI in any way and you agree it is your duty to verify such data prior to making campaign management decisions or transmitting instructions to your Customer Advertising Accounts. Edge.BI cannot be responsible for the speed, accuracy or completeness of the instructions you transmit to your Customer Advertising Accounts through the Service because Edge.BI does not own, operate or control all portions or the network or software through which such transactions are processed. You therefore agree that your Customer Advertising Account is the only reliable source to verify that your management decisions are carried out as accurately and completely as the third party advertising provider's system allows. You are responsible to inform Edge.BI immediately as soon as you identify any discrepancies between your Customer Advertising Account and your User Account. You are also responsible for making sure that Customer Orders or Customer Advertising Account management decisions are not duplicated or are properly canceled to avoid redundant instructions. 

5.3 No Guaranteed Access. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Service, as well as any third party advertising provider services (including but not limited to Google AdWords, Facebook Advertising, Yahoo Search Marketing, and Microsoft adCenter) and the terms upon which all of the foregoing are available are continually under experimentation and development. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and your use of the Service do not create any estoppel, or other rights to continued access, and you hereby waive and agree not to assert any such claims under contract law or any other legal theory against Edge.BI or the third party advertising providers you access through the Service or Application. You acknowledge and agree that Edge.BI may suspend or terminate your access to the Service or to any of the third party advertising providers through the Service, or change any of the specifications, protocols or methods of access, at any time, for any reason, or for no reason, and will bear no liability for such decisions. It is solely your responsibility at all times to backup your data and to be prepared to manage your Customer Advertising Accounts and conduct your business without access to the Service or any particular feature or set of features or third party access therein. Edge.BI does not represent or warrant, and specifically disclaims, that the Service or any third party advertising provider data or data in your User Account or your Customer Advertising Account will be available without interruption or without bugs. 

6. Intellectual Property. 
Edge.BI alone (and its licensors, where applicable) shall own all right, title and interest, including all related intellectual property rights, in and to the Edge.BI Service, and any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by you or any other party relating to the Service (collectively "Edge.BI Property"). This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey to you any rights of ownership in or related to the Edge.BI Property. In the event Edge.BI desires to seek any intellectual property protection for the Edge.BI Property, including, but not limited to, any patent, patent application, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret, invention or other rights that require further evidence of your agreement to Edge.BI's intellectual property ownership, then you shall upon request, and without further consideration, execute such further documents as Edge.BI may reasonably request to evidence such rights in Edge.BI The Edge.BI name, the Edge.BI logo, and the product names associated with the Service and all related indicia are Edge.BI Property unless designated as owned by third parties, and no right or license is granted to use them.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, your Evaluation Period shall terminate thirty (30) calendar days from the date on which your User Account is first created and activated with Edge.BI For avoidance of doubt, an Evaluation Period may not be extended, restarted, renewed, nor shall any Customer, whether an individual or organization or entity be entitled to multiple Evaluation Periods. You agree not to create more than one User Account on your or your organization's behalf for purposes of extending Evaluation Periods or accessing the Service for more than the Evaluation Period initially offered to you or your organization.

In consideration of any such Evaluation Period, you agree to use your reasonable good faith efforts to provide feedback to Edge.BI upon request regarding your experiences in using the Service. Such requests for feedback may come in the form of customer satisfaction surveys, requests for bug reporting, requests for evaluation comments, request for customer references, or participation in development of Frequently Asked Questions or support guidelines. Your refusal to participate in such reasonably requested feedback shall be grounds in Edge.BI's discretion to terminate your Evaluation Period or access to the Service. All evaluation information provided to Edge.BI by Customer shall be Edge.BI Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Evaluation Period you shall remain responsible for the payment of all third party fees and all costs related to your Customer Advertising Account as further described below.

You will be required to provide Edge.BI with a valid credit card or approved purchase order together with approved credit authorization and payment terms as a condition to signing up for the Service. If you are not requested to provide such credit card and purchase order at the commencement of your Evaluation Period, you agree to do so immediately upon request or to have your User Account terminated without further notice. You agree to provide Edge.BI with complete and accurate billing and contact information and to keep such information updated.

You agree to immediately notify Edge.BI if your credit card is lost or stolen or your credit card account otherwise becomes unavailable for any reason. At the end of each month, or as otherwise mutually agreed, Edge.BI will automatically bill your credit card for the Fees accrued on your behalf for use of the Service. If you believe you are not responsible for any of the Fees in your credit card statement, or your account is otherwise incorrect you must contact us in writing within fifteen (15) days of the statement date. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable. You agree to be responsible and to pay to Edge.BI or its assignees, all reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys or other professionals.

Edge.BI's Fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, VAT) (collectively, "Taxes"). You shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any payments made hereunder, other than any taxes based on Edge.BI's net income. Edge.BI reserves the right to modify its Fees and to introduce new charges at any time, upon at least 30 days prior notice to you, which notice may be provided by e-mail or via your User Account or other notice of modification to the Pricing Information and/or Monthly Fees applicable to you. All Fees and pricing terms are confidential, and you agree not to disclose them to any third party. You are responsible for making payments to third party advertisers to satisfy all charges incurred under Customer Advertising Accounts as a result of your use of the Edge.BI Service pursuant to any applicable terms and conditions that may exist between you and the third party advertising providers.

Edge.BI may terminate this Agreement in its discretion if it reasonably believes you have violated any provision of this Agreement or our agreement with any third party advertising provider. If your use of the Service causes Edge.BI to incur excessive API charges, Edge.BI may, at its option terminate this Agreement or deny your continued use of the Service. Edge.BI will provide reasonable notice prior to taking the above actions. Any breach of your payment obligations or unauthorized use of Edge.BI's Service will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
